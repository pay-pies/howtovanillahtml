# How To Vanilla HTML & CSS ( A Guide )

This is a site which is a walkthrough through the basics of vanilla HTML & CSS. It can be accessed here https://pay-pies.neetocode.com/site/qingrui-xie/01JFXA9VW3TAXP1466STQS8ESY and has been hosted on neetocode.

I have used Vanilla HTML ( with CSS inside the style element ), edited in Microsoft VS Code (Visual Studio Code).

## How To Use

Click on the links on the sidebar to navigate the page and read through the information. At the very bottom, there are a few links to help you out if you are stuck. 

Time spent: 9 hours 24 mins 🟢🟡 ->🟥<- (least time-consuming to most)

### Note

Some of the links may not work in neetocode so you can right click and click open link in new tab or something.
